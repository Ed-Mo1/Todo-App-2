# Project Description: Todo App

You need to clone it and run the following commands:
npm run server
npm run dev

This project is a Todo App built using the following technologies:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- JSON Server: A full fake REST API that allows you to create a mock server for prototyping and testing.
- Redux Toolkit: The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- RTK Query: A data fetching and caching library that is part of the Redux Toolkit ecosystem, designed to simplify API calls and state management.

The Todo App allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, updating, and marking tasks as completed. It utilizes React for the front-end user interface, Tailwind CSS for styling, JSON Server for mocking the backend API, and Redux Toolkit along with RTK Query for state management and efficient data fetching.

The combination of these technologies enables a seamless user experience with responsive design, efficient state management, and easy integration with a mock server for realistic data interactions during development and testing.
